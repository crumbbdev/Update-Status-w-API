# Update Status with API  
Update your Discord status using the Discord V8 API.  

## How to?  

1. Create a file named `token.data` in the same directory as the main.py file.  
2. Paste your Discord token inside the file.  

If you're worried about storing your token somewhere, that's completely normal. You can read more about it [here](https://www.downelink.com/find-discord-token/).  

## How It Works  

The script (`main.py`) sends a request to Discord’s V8 API with your status and authorization token. Feel free to check the code yourself.
